## How to Run Locally (No Python Needed)

You can run this app directly from a USB drive on any Windows computerâ€”no installation or internet required!

### Steps:
1. **Plug in the USB drive.**
2. **Open the `dist` folder** (provided to you, containing `app.exe`, `templates/`, `static/`, and `instance/` folders).
3. **Double-click `app.exe`** to start the clinic management system.
4. **Open your web browser** and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

### Database Notes
- All your clinic data is stored in the file: `instance/clinic.db` (on the USB drive).
- **You do NOT need to do anything with the database.**
- All changes (new patients, visits, etc.) are saved automatically to the USB drive.
- If you move the USB to another computer, your data goes with it.

### Default Doctor Credentials
- **Username:** `doctor`
- **Password:** `password`

## (For Developers) Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Seed the database with demo data**
   ```bash
   python seed.py
   ```
5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. **Open in your browser:**
   - Go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Database Structure
- **Doctor**: id, username, password_hash
- **Patient**: id, name, father_name, age, sex, contact
- **Diagnosis**: id, code, description
- **Medication**: id, name
- **Visit**: id, patient_id, doctor_id, diagnosis_id, symptoms, date
- **Prescription**: id, visit_id, medication_id, dosage, duration

## Usage Notes
- **Add unlimited patients** via the "Register Patient" page.
- **Edit or delete any patient** from the "Patients" page.
- **Record unlimited visits** for any patient. Each visit can have multiple symptoms, a diagnosis, and any number of prescriptions.
- **Visit history** is shown for each patient when recording a new visit.
- **All data is stored in `clinic.db` (SQLite)**. You can view/edit this with any SQLite browser.
- **Print visit summaries** for professional records.

## Customization
- All UI is minimal, professional, and responsive.
- To change branding, edit the `CLINIC_BRAND` dictionary in `app.py`.
- To add more demo data, edit `seed.py` and re-run it (this will reset the database).
